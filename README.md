# About

This was fun toy project of reimplementing redis in Rust. 

Commands supported:

- [x] PING
- [x] ECHO
- [x] GET
- [x] SET


Note: This is meant to be educational only and in no way is complete in features, nor should it be used for any development/PoC purposes. This is probably a very naive implementation.
